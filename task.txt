Exercise – Part 3
Your  final  task  is  to  write  a  second  program  in  C  or  C++  to  remove  the  IP  and  TCP  headers
from
any
log file conforming to the format described above and extract the data transmitted from
machine  A  to  machine  B.  The  source  code  for  this  program  should  be  saved  in
extract.c
or
extract.cc
.  Your program must take two arguments on the command line, and open and read log
data from the filename passed as the first argument, and write data into a file whose name will be
passed as the second argument.  Your program should print an error message if a file with the name
of the first argument does not exist.  Your program should overwrite the data in any file with the
same name as the second argument, or create a file of this name if it does not exist.  For example,
if an executable form of your program was called
extract
then the following execution
./extract message1 message1.txt
will extract the data held in
message1
and write it into the file
message1.txt
.
Use your program to do the following:
•
Extract the data from
message1
and save this data into a new file called
message1.txt
.  View
this image Does the message make sense?  (If not, you probably need to debug your code!)
•
Extract the data from
message2
and save this data into a new file called
message2.jpg
.  By
using  a  web-browser  or  otherwise,  view  this  image.   What  does  the  image  show?   (If  you
cannot view the image you probably need to debug your code!)
•
(Optional)
Decipher the contents of
message3
and
message4
to claim the prize
